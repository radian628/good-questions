          <div class="bad">Any JavaScript pros around that can help me?</div>
          <div class="good">I am trying to do <code>X</code> with JavaScript, can someone help?</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you're asking for help, try to avoid walling off people&mdash;leave your question open so that anyone feels
          like they're allowed to answer it. This is important for programming in particular because what might
          <em>seem</em> like a language-specific question might actually be something that any experienced programmer
          would know, regardless of language. By asking for a "JavaScript pro," you might be walling off a Python pro
          who knows the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a similar note, avoid DMing someone a question when you can just as easily reach them in a public place
          (e.g. a group chat or forum) that they frequently visit. That way, not only can they answer, but someone else
          could as well.
        </p>
        <h2 id="be-upfront">Be Upfront&mdash;Minimize Back-and-Forth</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">Hey, I need some help with JavaScript.</div>
          <div class="good">
            I am trying to do <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, and <code>Z</code> with JavaScript. Here's what I've tried
            so far and here's why it failed:
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          <em>Add as much information as you can to your initial post</em> when you ask a question. This will make it
          easier to answer because the answerer won't have to ask as many clarifying questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, when communicating over an asynchronous medium, people prefer answering questions on their own
          time over carving out a specific, contiguous block of time to help someone. Furthermore, a lot of the time,
          they'll only have a minute or two to answer questions before they return to some other task. They won't want
          to respond to a question with a lot of back-and-forth because they might not know when they'll next have a
          break where they can follow up. They don't want to leave you hanging!
        </p>
        <h3 id="no-hello">"No Hello"</h3>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">Hi!</div>
          <div class="good">
            Hi! I ran into this problem with <code>X</code> the other day and needed some help with...
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another tempting mistake is to start with a greeting like "Hi!" or "Hello" in your first message, but send
          your actual question in a second message. Your first message will key the other person in that you want to
          talk, but you might lose their attention while writing out your actual question, because they might switch
          back to what they were doing before you greeted them. It's best to combine both greeting and question into one
          message.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sense, you should think of your messages as if you were
          <em>writing a letter to a pen pal, and not a live phone call</em>. It wouldn't make sense to send a pen pal a
          single letter consisting of "hi!" and nothing else.

        <h2 id="xy-problem">State Your Problem, Not Just Your Solution</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">How do I do <code>Y</code>?</div>
          <div class="good">How do I do <code>Y</code>? I'm trying to use it to solve <code>X</code>.</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you have a problem and only ask about the way you intend to solve it, you lose the opportunity for others
          to suggest other, potentially better solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phenomenon is also know as the "XY Problem"&mdash;the phenomenon where someone wants to do
          <code>X</code> but (incorrectly) thinks they can solve it by doing <code>Y</code>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="stay-async">Stay in the Asynchronous Communication Channel (if Possible)</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">I need help with <code>X</code>! Can someone join a voice call with me?</div>
          <div class="good">
            I need help with <code>X</code>! Voice call if possible but it's fine if you answer here.
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you are asking for help in an asynchronous medium, (one where people don't necessarily have to communicate
          in real time&mdash;e.g. email, a chat room, forums) then it's best to keep communication asynchronous. Trying
          to move communication to a synchronous, real-time medium (e.g. a voice/video call) will likely be a turn-off
          for potential answerers because it means they have to carve out a block of time where they are dedicated on
          answering your question. On the other hand, in an asynchronous medium, they are free to reply whenever they
          have spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't to say that synchronous communication is bad, nor is it bad to ask if you need synchronous
          communication to learn. Whether an answerer wants to join a voice call is their choice. The main issue is that
          <em>fewer</em> people will be willing to help you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="dont-know-what-you-dont-know">Not Everyone Knows What You Don't Know</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">I already know <code>X</code>!</div>
          <div class="good">The part I'm more confused about is <code>Y</code>.</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Remember that the people helping you likely won't know what aspects of the problem you're familiar
          with&mdash;and those you aren't familiar with. Thus, you'll often run into cases where you're told things you
          already know. While it might seem tempting to get defensive, remember that the person helping you isn't doing
          this to talk down to you&mdash;they just don't know what you already know, and would rather not confuse you
          (and thus waste your time) talking about things you would not yet understand. The best way to handle a
          situation like this is to <em>redirect the conversation to what you don't know.</em>
        </p>
        <h2 id="avoid-being-secretive">Avoid Being Secretive (if Possible)</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">How do I do <code>X</code>?</div>
          <div class="good">
            How do I do <code>X</code>? I'm making it for <code>PROJECT</code> which does <code>Y</code> and
            <code>Z</code>.
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, if you're getting help with a project, you might feel tempted to be secretive about it, perhaps
          to keep it as a surprise or to prevent others from taking your ideas. However, being secretive is also a big
          hindrance to fixing your project's issues you because it may result in <a href="#xy-problem">XY Problems</a>:
          By not revealing the underlying end goal of your project, you're not giving others the opportunity to present
          better ways of achieving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being secretive also makes helping more difficult because in a secretive project, helpers are likely to lack
          crucial information, preventing them from making informed decisions.
        </p>
        <h2 id="explain-how-you-did-it">Explain How You Solved Your Problem</h2>

          <div class="good">
            Nevermind, fixed it! Turns out that I had to add <code>X</code> in order to get it working.
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you asked a question in a public forum and later found the solution on your own, explain how you solved it
          so that other people with the same problem can solve it too if they find your question.
        </p>
        <h2 id="helpers-are-volunteers">Helpers Are (Often) Volunteers</h2>
        <p>
          In the end, remember that, unless they're getting paid to help you, the people helping you are ultimately
          volunteering their own time to do so, and thus are under no obligation to keep helping you. Don't let this
          stop you from seeking help, however&mdash;because they're volunteering, they almost certainly <em>want</em> to
          help you either way, even if they are not required to.

            <a href="#cast-a-wide-net">"Asking to ask"</a> becomes necessary because IRL, talking to someone takes their
            full attention and can't be delayed, so it's polite to ask first. Conversely, an online, text-based question
            does not demand your attention and can be read later, at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#no-hello">"No hello"</a> becomes bad advice in person because greetings establish conversations.
            If you were busy doing something and someone <em>immediately</em> began talking to you, you'd likely miss
            the start of what they said, since you can't immediately switch focus. Online, on the other hand, you can
            take a look at someone's question whenever you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#be-upfront">Being upfront</a> becomes a problem because of information overload. If someone
            monologued about their problem to you for ten minutes IRL, you wouldn't be able to remember all of what they
            said. On the other hand, online, you don't <em>have</em> to remember, because the text will still be there
            after you've read it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In other words, someone breaking these rules is likely doing so because they are applying IRL standards to an
          online forum.

          <i>Wait... so if I'm not supposed to link to this site, why does it even exist?</i> These sorts of sites are
          better to link in rules pages, bios, and other such public places where many people can see them, as opposed
          to being used as <em>directed, unsolicited advice</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To some, responding to a question with a link to a site like this (or DontAskToAsk, No Hello, etc.) can come
          off as rude, dismissive, and accusatory, regardless of the tone of the site itself. It can feel like
          contacting customer service and getting an automated response from a bot&mdash;one entirely unrelated to your
          problem&mdash;instead of a real human. Furthermore, depending on the site, responses like these can encourage
          people to get defensive, as they sometimes paint people asking questions as being lazy or malicious, even if
          they're acting out of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of linking a page, try crafting a short response tailored to the user's specific problem. If possible,
          frame it as you trying to <em>help them</em> get their question answered. Avoid being antagonistic for no
          reason. If you're concerned about time, keep in mind that crafting a response should ideally only take you a
          few seconds.

          It can be tempting to help with something you can't realistically help with. After all, the person you offered
          to help likely now has the expectation that you know what you're talking about, and you'd rather not let them
          down. However, giving someone incorrect advice will harm them more in the long run than admitting that you
          don't know something.

      <h2 id="ok-but-why">Why use this site? Why not just link to DontAskToAsk?</h2>
      <p>
        As much as I like the message behind sites like <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">Don't Ask to Ask</a> and
        <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">Smart Questions</a>, (both inspired this site!) I
        think both of these resources&mdash;and many more&mdash;are unnecessarily harsh toward their intended
        recipients. Consider the POV of a clueless new user who asks a question the "wrong" way&mdash;they try to ask a
        question they believe is sufficient, only to be told that they're "lazy" and an "idiot." It's a bad first
        impression that could drive a new, unconfident, well-meaning user away from your community. Furthermore, by
        accusing people of poor etiquette, they'll be inclined to get defensive instead of addressing their issues as to
        not appear like a "bad person."
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal with this site is to send a message similar to existing sites, but to present the advice as a win-win
        for both parties, and to cut out the accusations and sarcasm. That way, if you link it to someone, they'll be
        more likely to see it for what it is&mdash;a helping hand&mdash;as opposed to an insult.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, if you have ideas for tips of your own or want to make general improvements to the site,
        <a href="https://github.com/radian628/good-questions">feel free to open an issue or make a PR here!</a>
